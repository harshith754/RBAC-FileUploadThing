# FileUpload RBAC Demo

A modern, full-stack Next.js 15 application demonstrating robust **role-based access control (RBAC)** and seamless **file upload** capabilities. Built with a focus on security, scalability, and developer experience, this project leverages the latest tools and best practices in the React/Next.js ecosystem.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**

  - Fine-grained user roles (Admin, Super Admin, User, etc.)
  - Secure, server-enforced permissions for all sensitive actions
  - Admin dashboard for user management

- **File Upload System:**

  - Drag-and-drop file uploads with progress tracking
  - Uploads are stored in Cloudinary for scalability and performance
  - Uploaded files are associated with users in the database
  - File size formatting, error handling, and upload queue UI

- **Authentication & User Management:**

  - Powered by [Clerk](https://clerk.com) for seamless sign-in, sign-up, and user profile management
  - Clerk metadata is used to assign and enforce roles

- **Modern UI & Components:**

  - Built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for beautiful, accessible, and customizable React components
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile

- **Database & ORM:**

  - [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as the type-safe ORM
  - [Neon](https://neon.tech/) serverless Postgres for scalable, fast, and reliable data storage
  - Prisma Accelerate for optimized query performance

- **API Routes & Server Actions:**

  - Next.js App Router with server actions for secure, type-safe backend logic
  - RESTful API endpoints for file upload, user creation, and more

- **Developer Experience:**
  - TypeScript-first codebase
  - ESLint, Prettier, and strict type-checking
  - Postinstall scripts ensure Prisma client is always generated

- **shadcn/ui** ‚Äì UI primitives and components
- **Clerk** ‚Äì Authentication, user management, and RBAC metadata
- **Prisma** ‚Äì Type-safe ORM for Postgres
- **Neon** ‚Äì Serverless Postgres database
- **Cloudinary** ‚Äì File storage and CDN for uploads
- **formidable** ‚Äì Node.js file upload parser
- **lucide-react** ‚Äì Icon library

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users sign up/sign in with Clerk. Roles are assigned via Clerk metadata.
2. **RBAC Enforcement:**
   - Server actions and API routes check user roles before allowing access to admin features or file management.
3. **File Upload:**
   - Users upload files via a drag-and-drop UI. Files are sent to a Next.js API route, parsed with formidable, uploaded to Cloudinary, and saved in Neon Postgres via Prisma.
4. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Admins can view and manage users, assign roles, and see uploaded files.
